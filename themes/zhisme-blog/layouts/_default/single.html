            “AMSL’s aircraft could become an important tool for emergency services personnel,
            particularly
            as we
            face more frequent natural disasters,” said Chris Bower, minister for climate change and
            energy.
            “Green hydrogen and other sustainable aviation fuels are vital to help decarbonize the
            hard-to-abate
            aviation sector, now accounting for around 2.5% of global emissions.”
            </p>
            <p>
            This is not the only EAV targeted at first responders, expected to be among the earliest use
            cases
            for the new electric flying vehicles.

            The two record-breaking displays came at the end of three nights of smaller, 400-drone
            shows,
            where
            the drones were programmed to create displays of “heroic figures throughout history.”

            An email, a document, a research paper, a presentation, and even a JavaDoc code block
            consist of
            paragraphs, <a href="#">which are</a> “self-contained units of discourse in writing dealing
            with
            a particular
            point
            or idea.” Visually, paragraphs are supposed to be separated by a vertical space that is a
            bit
            larger
            than a vertical spacing between lines. To achieve this, for example, in HTML, we wrap

            people
            insert what <a href="#">are called</a> “soft line breaks” inside paragraphs—this is a bad

            An email, a document, a research paper, a presentation, and even a JavaDoc code block
            consist of
            paragraphs, <a href="#">which are</a> “self-contained units of discourse in writing dealing
            with
            a particular
            point
            or idea.” Visually, paragraphs are supposed to be separated by a vertical space that is a
            bit
            larger
            than a vertical spacing between lines. To achieve this, for example, in HTML, we wrap
            paragraphs
            in
            the
            &lt;p&gt; tag, while in LaTeX, we use \par or just an empty line between them. However, some
            people
            insert what <a href="#">are called</a> “soft line breaks” inside paragraphs—this is a bad
            practice that I
            suggest
            you stay away from.
