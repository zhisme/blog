As software engineers, we’re used to writing tests — but we don’t always know how to write them well. We aim to cover the most significant lines of code, often guided by intuition. This book is a practical guide to writing better tests, and I found it to be a valuable resource for anyone involved in software testing — whether you're a developer or a tester.

This book focuses on automated software testing — **what** to test, and **how**. It walks you through best practices and explains why solid testing is essential for long-term maintainability and support.

Automated testing isn’t exclusive to software. It's used in many industries. Take manufacturing, for example: when a car is assembled, it undergoes crash tests and other checks to ensure it meets industry standards. If it doesn't, the product is pulled back for fixes and re-engineering.

I’m not even talking about manual testing here — which many developers tend to avoid. Instead, we often test only the "happy-path" and quickly report that our feature branch is ready for someone else to QA.

Let me quote myself from my review of the draft version of the book:
{{< quote author="Evgeny Zhdanov" authorPic="me.jpg" citeCaption="One of the reviewers" >}}
As developers, we tend to do "soft testing" — testing only the happy or green path — or being too polite with our code. We treat it like our child and want to be nice to it. This is wrong. I’d even say it’s a completely flawed way of thinking. And of course, we’re often too lazy to dive deep — we’ve got deadlines, and no one really appreciates the extra two hours spent tracking down an edge case that might only occur in 1% of real-world use.
But I believe we should push for better. As developers, we should go beyond just “working software.” We should actively try to break our code — with no guilt about doing so. Our software shouldn't be fragile. That wasn’t the mindset of our engineering ancestors who built systems that are still functioning today — like those used in space missions or military tech. They didn’t half-test their products with a “soft testing” mentality.
At the very least, we should remember that and be honest with ourselves.

From personal experience, I can say that many times I’ve written code I thought was production-ready — only to discover bugs or poor design decisions when I started writing tests for it. Testing reveals flaws and forces you to improve your architecture.

Software testing is a topic worth hours of discussion. In fact, the IT industry now has entire roles dedicated to it: Manual QA, Automation QA. That alone tells you how important it is. Great products aren’t just made by brilliant engineers — they’re made through hours of focused work from skilled testers who approach the system from entirely different angles. Catching issues early is far cheaper than fixing them post-release — not to mention the bad reputation that can follow a poorly-tested product.

Now, let the author explain what drove him to write this book:
{{< quote author="Yegor Bugayenko" citeCaption="\"Angry Tests\" author" authorPic="yegor256.jpg" >}}
    I wrote this book in just a few months because I couldn't keep all this information bottled up any longer. I'm frustrated with the consistently poor quality of tests my colleagues and I often write. This book is my attempt to lay out best practices in a clear, formal way — something we can all refer to and rely on. I expect to use it myself as a practical, no-nonsense reference guide, where the key principles are spelled out and easy to find.

As the author says, it's his attempt to lay out best practices clearly and formally. I strongly encourage you to read it — you'll gain knowledge that will pay off later, especially when your product hits problems in production. Treat your automated tests as an investment in your future.

Personally, I really enjoyed the experience of reviewing this book. It was my first time doing something like this, and I’d encourage you to volunteer for similar projects. It’s a great way to deepen your understanding of a topic, challenge your assumptions, and find new sources to expand your knowledge.

I also have to admit — it felt great to be part of something bigger than just myself.

When I received my printed copy, I went through it page by page, checking whether the review notes I originally sent to the author were taken into account. And when I saw some of my feedback incorporated, I felt proud. We’re all human — we thrive on community, contribution, and the recognition of our peers. That’s just in our nature.

It took me more time than I initially expected to finish the review, but it was fun and rewarding. As I said, I really recommend taking on activities like this from time to time — giving feedback to others, especially on topics you care about. It’s a small act, but the return is big: your own growth and inspiration.

And of course — read good books. They challenge your thinking, give your brain new ideas, and help you become a better professional.
