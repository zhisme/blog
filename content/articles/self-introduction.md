  This is the first blog post on my new blog. I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working on robotics and AI.
  Testing the blog with a simple post. [Latex](http://google.com/)

Almost every document you may write in [Latex](http://google.com/) <a href="#">LaTeX</a> format will have a list of references at
the end. Most likely, you will use <a href="#">BibTeX</a> or <a href="#">BibLaTeX</a> to print this list of references
in a nicely formatted way. It is also highly probable that your .bib file will contain
many typographic, stylistic, and logical mistakes. I’m fairly certain that you won’t
find the time to identify and correct them. As a result, the “References” section in
your paper may appear sloppy. I suggest using the <a href="#">bibcop</a> package, which identifies
mistakes in the .bib file and auto-fixes some of them.
