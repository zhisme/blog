## Why This Opinion Has Weight

I came to these conclusions through a series of crash and burns. Both as a team leader and as an employee willing to join a company. Concatenating together both worlds that conflict with each other, I believe my opinion has weight because it came from practical observations as a participant from both sides. I'm not going to theory-craft about the subject, but to share opinions that have grown in my mind and can be used as practical advice for anyone wondering or meeting the same obstacles and problems.

## Growing Pains Are Real

Growing as a company is not only a joy of meeting new opportunities and becoming a greater player in the market, but also the pain of hiring and growing new employees.

However, this article is not going to inspect the hiring process with the usual caveats about interviewing - whether to focus on practical skills or check theory knowledge of programming languages and related technologies. That's been discussed to death.

## The Interview Problem Nobody Talks About

You need an employee who is not only willing to interview other people and give them a rating during a short period (1-1.5h calls), but who also has appropriate communication skills and enough practical/hard skills to actually rate and grade the candidate fairly, comparing them with others while taking many details into consideration.

Mostly this is done by team leads/CTOs or through two stages: interview with your future team leader, then with the technical guy called CTO.

**One important thing I believe should be mandatory:** the interviewer should relate to you in some way in your future employment. I mean they should be either from your team (you will be talking to them directly) or they will manage you (your team leader).

Otherwise it leads to unnecessary conflicts like: "Who rated this guy and why should I take him into my team? I don't like him and wouldn't ever have considered him to be a member of MY team."

This last point is especially valid for medium-to-big companies, where the hiring process is mostly sent to some guys who interview and then don't care about the person they interviewed, breaking all relational things between people. No responsibility, no empathy - "we hired yet another guy and now it's your responsibility (the team he is going into)." This is bad practice.

Another problematic scenario: when a guy is being interviewed by some big boss (technical director/CTO) who never in his career wrote code - or even worse, some project manager who doesn't know at all what's in a developer's head. This is extra stress for both the interviewer and the candidate, because they speak different languages. It also looks like your company has big problems if your directors have free time to interview regular employees. Sounds like a red flag.

## The Homework Nobody Does

Before hiring, there should be homework done by the company.

First question: Why did we decide to hire new people?

Most common answer: "We currently have too many tasks and we can't handle them, we need new hands to deal with them."

**Totally wrong approach.** Let me tell you why.

Yes, it's a great marker that you need new people because your current team can't handle it by their capacity (you don't really want them to overtime and burn out). But there's more to it.

### What "Homework" Means

Before wanting to hire someone to solve tasks, there should also be willingness to help and understand the pains of a newcomer to the company. Besides stressful interviews which are more like university exams nowadays (spoiler: there will be another blog post about why interview-as-exam is bad and why it offends people).

Besides the willingness to hire, you have to also grow or already have people that you can rely on - people who know the product very well and like to guide and help others. Because they will be the representation of your company for the next long months for the newcomer.

The newcomer should be comfortable with the person who will guide them. If the product is big, it takes time to know most of it, and the newcomer will need help understanding everything.

I would say the person (let's call them mentor or buddy or team leader, whatever) will have to babysit the newcomer for the first month - to help them understand everything that's going on in the company, what the processes are (besides development), how to grow, what their perspectives are, where they can ask stupid questions and what other people will think about them.

Too bad if you don't have processes or they're too widespread - this should be done even earlier before homework, because running a company with a set of strict rules/processes is like riding in a burning car.

This is a very complex topic. You have to be prepared. These are only a few nuances that come to mind.

### Understanding the Risks

I'm not even talking about hiring the wrong guy who will imitate work and spend your resources for no reason without anything coming back in return.

Are you aware of the risks? That you may hire the wrong person, a liar, or a guy who is looking for some company to join for a short period to make some money/experience and leave (it's already in his mindset/personality - you can't change that).

You will spend time onboarding a guy who is planning to leave in a year.

Can you imagine the previous steps, where you create a cool atmosphere for people, investing time and money in them, and afterwards they just leave? Without even starting valuable contributions.

That's why we don't like guys who spent 1 year in one company, 1.5 years in another. For me it's always like: he did something he didn't care about, and left (or was fired) before anything complex or valuable began to be implemented. Imagine that!

## The Recruitment Mess

Another valuable aspect of homework is HR (recruiter) preparation.

Nowadays recruitment is a mess. How are people currently being recruited? Somewhere on LinkedIn or - even worse - on a job board, a recruiter finds the CV of a guy whose tech stack mostly looks like it matches your company's (>60%) and then schedules a call asking some script-like questions:

- "What motivates you daily?"
- "How did you start programming?"
- "How do you see your career in 5 years?"

If there was no swearing during this call, HR passes the candidate to tech guys who should deal with the person. Most of the time they'll do an exam-like interview with them, solving tasks from LeetCode with medium-high complexity, and then reporting to the boss that this guy can be hired (if he completed the LeetCode stuff well enough).

This point is also valid for recruitment agencies, not only your company recruiter.

**Totally wrong! Complete nonsense.**

This is the totally incorrect way of hiring a person. If you follow this way, you will get "somewhat developers" who will leave you in 1-2 years, or will be with you forever never doing their job fully (unless you fire them). This is the proper way to hire mediocre players - not bad, not good, just something.

## The Best Way to Interview

**The best way to interview someone is to have no interview at all.**

Yep, that's simple. How can this be achieved?

### Option 1: Internal Recommendations

When I have a recommendation from someone inside the company who I trust and they will be responsible for the guy if he fails. As a company, I would give him a try anyway.

### Option 2: Proven Track Record

When the guy has medals, achievements that outweigh any interview. Maybe he won ICPC and has recommendations that he can solve our problems or he's interested in our product.

Do you need to solve LeetCode with him? Hell no. Only if you want to lose him and make a fool of yourself.

### Option 3: Detective-Level Recruiting

This is the recruiter homework. Besides just grabbing a CV and looking for skills match/no match, there should be detective-like activity:

1. **Get in touch with the person** - Talk to them as a recruiter, grab information they share
2. **Understand their psychology** - Make notes about them as a personality, their previous experience and what they expect from a new company
3. **Check their CV thoroughly** - Try to get in touch with their previous companies, get ratings about them, what previous bosses and colleagues say about them, take 3rd party opinions
4. **Google them** - Do they have open-source projects? Some medals? University projects? Maybe they do blogging where they make posts which the recruiter can read and make even more notes
5. **Be creative** - Gather info about them like you're a detective

Give this information to the team leader/project manager who will be their buddy/mentor in the next few months. Put it on the table next to their CV, so they can inspect them more precisely and understand who is potentially going to join them.
