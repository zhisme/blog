## 1. Information I Collect

### a. Analytics

This site gives you a **choice** between two analytics services:

**Option 1: [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) (Default, Privacy-Friendly)**
- If you decline cookie consent or haven't made a choice yet
- **No cookies**, no personal data collection
- Open-source, privacy-first analytics
- Only tracks basic page views and referrers
- GDPR compliant by design

**Option 2: Google Analytics (If You Consent)**
- Only loads if you click "Ok, got it" on the cookie banner
- Collects more detailed analytics data including:
  - Pages visited
  - Browser and device type
  - Referring site or link
  - Approximate geolocation (country-level)
  - Time spent on the site
- Uses cookies to track sessions

Both services help me understand what content performs well and how to improve the blog. Your choice is saved in your browser's local storage.

### b. Newsletter Subscriptions

If you sign up for my newsletter, I collect your **email address** via a subscription form. This data is stored securely and only used to send occasional updates or announcements. You can unsubscribe at any time via the link in any email.

### c. Comments via Disqus

This site uses **Disqus** for comments. When you post a comment, Disqus may collect information like your name, email, IP address, and the comment itself. Disqus handles this data according to their own [Privacy Policy](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717103-disqus-privacy-policy).

3. **"Read more"** - View this policy before deciding
