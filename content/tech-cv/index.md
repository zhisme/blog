summary_short: "Senior Software Engineer with 10 years of professional experience. Ruby/Rails core. Builds systems, ships them, leads the team."

about:
  - |
    <strong>10 years of professional experience in software engineering, mainly Ruby/Rails.</strong> Last 2 years as team lead — roughly 40% code, 60% architecture and coordination.
    Built payment processing integrations, HR automation platforms, and the teams around them.
    Looking for roles where I own technical decisions and ship with a small team.
  - |
    <strong>Engineering philosophy:</strong> I don't trust theory disconnected from production.
    I work across the stack and pick up whatever the problem requires — language, protocol, or tool.
    I hire quiet engineers who deliver over charismatic ones who write reports.
    I build processes (ticket → review → CI → deploy) because good pipelines prevent fires better than heroics.
